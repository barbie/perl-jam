What is Perl Jam?
-----------------

The Perl Community is a wonderful thing. It is a collective of people who share
a common interest, the Perl programming language, but express that interest in
so many different ways. The projects, user groups and events all capture a
different part of the community, but it wasn't until the late 90s that the
community started to co-ordinate their activities.

In 1998 the first Perl Workshop took place in Germany, and in 1999 the first
YAPC Perl conference took place. These were the beginnings, but the events
themselves have grown and become further reaching than the initial core
developers that came along to those first events.

Perl Jam aims to collect together the knowledge and experience of organising
some great Perl events, and order them in such a way that anyone wishing to do
the same, can follow the footsteps of those who have gone before, and prepare
themselves for what will hopefully become a great event.

Intended Audience
-----------------

I assume readers have some interest in organising a technical conference. While
the book focuses on the Perl programming language, and the YAPC and Perl
Workshops, much of the content is applicable to any large technical event,
whether Open Source or commercial.


Reviewer Guidelines
-------------------

I appreciate all suggestions and critiques, especially:

 * is the work accurate?
 * is the work complete?
 * is the work coherent?
 * are there missing sections and subjects?
 * are the examples effective?
 * is the flow of information appropriate?

Building this Book
------------------

The Markdown source files are converted into the final book via
[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), hence you will need to install this first in
order to build the book.  Once installed, and assuming you have GNU `make`
also installed, building the PDF version of the book should be as simple as:

    $ make pdf

This will produce the file `perl-jam.pdf` in the root project directory.

Building the epub version is equally simple:

    $ make epub

which will produce the file `perl-jam.epub` in the root project directory.

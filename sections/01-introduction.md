# AN INTRODUCTION

This book is aimed anyone who wishes to organise a conference or large technical
event, and wishes to benefit from the experiences of other event organisers who
have gone before.

While the content of the book does draw experience from organising Perl events,
partly due to the author having organised or consulted for several Perl events,
it is hoped that the experience and ideas will be applicable to any OpenSource
event.

The Perl Community is a wonderful thing. It is a collective of people who share
a common interest, the Perl programming language, but express that interest in
so many different ways. The projects, user groups and events all capture a
different part of the community, but it wasn't until the late 90s that the
community started to co-ordinate their activities.

In February 1999 the first Perl Workshop took place in Germany, and in June 1999
the first YAPC Perl conference took place. These were the beginnings, but the
events themselves have grown and become further reaching than the initial small
group of core developers that came along to those first events.

This book was originally written to provide help and advice for anyone
organizing a "Yet Another Perl Conference" (YAPC) event, since renamed to "The
Perl Conference" in 2016. However, it contains many examples and hints for
proposing, planning, and running any successful conference, workshop or large
technical event. While there are some aspects that may only be applicable to a
Perl event, much of the content will be informative for any group wanting to
promote collaborative efforts and further discussion on a focused technical
topic, or who are thinking of planning their own Open Source conference,
workshop or large technical event.

The intended audience for this book is a small, but dedicated team that would
like to plan, prepare and hold an event. Sometimes the organisers are located
in the place where the event is to be held, but many roles and responsibilties
only require that the organiser has an internet connection. Having the support
of local user groups or others from the community can help to spread the
workload, but a small core team needs to co-ordinate activities.

Throughout this book, the focus is very much on YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe, as
these are the two annual conferences that the author has first hand experience
with. In future revisions, it is hoped that experiences and suggestions from
those involved with other events (including non-Perl events) will also feature.
Feel free to ignore the specific references that may not be applicable to
organising your event.

## What Is A YAPC?

Just in case you've come across this book and are not familiar with the Perl
Community or even the wider Open Source community, you might be wondering what
a YAPC is.

The YAPC acronym comes from "Yet Another Perl Conference", although it is
rarely known by its full title these days, and is pronounced "YAP-SEE".

## What is TPC?

Since 2016, the YAPC events have been renamed to The Perl Conference, or TPC.
The original The Perl Conference was a corportae event held by O'Reilly
Associates in America, which by TPC4 in 2000 was incorporated with OSCON
(Open Source Conference). From OSCON 2001, TPC became the Perl Track within
the bigger conference, and the name's usage lapsed.

Following a request from The Perl Foundation, O'Reilly Associates granted
the Perl community the name and enable the renaming of YAPCs to The Perl
Conference.

## What is a Conference?

An OpenSource conference event traditionally lasts around three days, with
further days of classes, tutorials, workshops, hackathons or seminars
occasionally preceding and/or following the main event.

The core event days feature keynotes, talks, lightning talks, birds of a feather
sessions (BOFs) and open discussions for the whole assembly. Any additional days
around the conference are either limited-attendance classes or dedicated
small-group events that will appeal to only a small number of attendees.

A YAPC/TPC event is meant to be an inexpensive, grassroots conference primarily
focused on the Perl programming language, and is aimed at beginners and experts
alike. Although organized by volunteers, the events are supported by The Perl
Foundation (TPF) globally and the YAPC::Europe Foundation (YEF) in Europe.
Both TPF and YEF are non-profit organisations, and often the local organising
group will establish themselves with a similar status. Any profit raised by the
events is used to help fund future local events or the local user groups
activities, some may be donated to future events or to the TPF/YEF
organisations, while some may help to fund Perl development projects.

The original idea for the conferences came as a reaction to expensive
commercial conferences, and aimed to bring more self-funded individuals (such
as students or developers with or without their employer's support) into the
Perl community, as well as giving those same individuals a chance to share
ideas and contribute to Perl projects. However, in more recent years, the
corporate world has seen the benefit of sponsoring the events, which has
enabled many high-profile members of the Perl community to attend and speak at
the events, as well as helping to ensure the conferences still remain
relatively inexpensive.

## A Bit Of History

In 1999 the first Yet Another Perl Conference was held in Pittsburgh, PA at
Carnegie Mellon University and had about 275 participants. The event was
attended by a small but mighty group of interested and interesting Perl people,
including Larry Wall, who delivered the opening keynote on the first day of the
two-day event. The primary organiser of the event was Kevin Lenzo, who then
created the Yet Another Society to help administer the YAPCs.

The following year a group of London Perl Mongers decided to follow
Pittsburgh's lead and organised the first YAPC::Europe in 2000 (or 19100 as it
was originally listed) at the Institute Of Contemporary Arts, on the Mall (a
short walk from Buckingham Palace).

Since then other YAPCs have established themselves around the world, with some
evolving into wider interest Open Source Developers Conferences (OSDC)
incorporating Perl, Python, Ruby and several other languages.

Most of the organisers for these events began their conference planning with the
same limited knowledge and experience you have right now. Reading this book will
enable you to avoid some of the pitfalls that others have fall into, and will
prepare you for the work ahead.

=head1 CONFERENCE EVENTS

Z<conference_events> The following are all activities that can take place during the conference. Some 
are nice to have, so don't feel pressured to provide all of them.

=head2 Day Trips & Partner Programmes

If feasible, see if you can organise a partner programme during the event. Many 
attendees bring partners, family or friends along with them, and while the 
conference may well be of interest to the attendee, their entourage may not be 
so thrilled.

At the very least, suggest places to visit. Museums and places of interest 
should already be featured in local guides. Ask your volunteers if they are 
willing to act as tour guides for a small group. Failing that, is there a 
professional tour guide company that would be willing to do a special rate for 
you? In the last two cases you will need to get an estimate for how many will be 
taking advantage of the partner programme, and may even need to charge a fee to 
cover costs.

Some attendees will plan to arrive several days early or leave a few days after 
the conference to take in some sightseeing. Try to arrange a day trip somewhere 
if you can, although this usually works best after the event, as more people 
have gotten to know each other. If you have other commitments, at least see if 
you can arrange to meet up in the evening for a meal or on pub outing. These can 
give early arrivals a chance to socialise somewhere you know is good (remember 
that many attendees may not have been your city before), as well as for late 
leavers to say a final farewell.

=head2 Early Arrivals Dinner

Depending upon how you are planning to do your pre-registration, you may want to 
try to arrange for everyone arriving early to meet for food. Many attendees will 
be arriving the day before the conference, and would rather be guided towards 
somewhere for food and drink, than have to find it for themselves and 
potentially make a bad judgement.

If you are just meeting in a bar or pub, make sure you can suggest good eating 
venues nearby (include options for those on a low budget or with special 
dietary requirements).

The Early Arrivals Dinner is always at the attendees own expense, and should not 
be part of your conference budget. However, do recommend somewhere for this to 
take place and possibly book it if you can. When deciding on a place to 
recommend, always talk to the manager for a large conference. Explain that you 
are expecting 100+ attendees to turn up on the night. Do they have staff to 
cope, can they make that many food orders, will there be enough beer? It is not 
unusual for the meetup venue to not believe you, and find that 150 people 
suddenly turn up, wanting beer and food, with 1 or 2 staff behind the bar, not 
enough food and not enough beer. And yes it has been known for attendees to 
drink a pub dry!

Emphasise that the establishment is likely to take several thousand through 
their tills, and it really is worth their while getting extra staff, food and 
beer in.

=head2 Conference Dinner

The conference dinner is always a nice to have, but you should either get 
sponsorship for it, or only include it once you have covered all your basic 
costs. Like the venue, it can be a large cost to your budget. If you are hosting 
the conference at a university, you may find they are able to provide facilities 
for large numbers for either a sit-down meal or buffet. Other large venues 
(pubs, bars and hotels) with function rooms may also be available with catering. 
Toronto even managed to secure a buffet on a paddle steamer around Toronto 
Harbour for YAPC::NA 2005.

Ensure you consider dietary preferences. As mentioned in Chapter 1 (see
'Catering - Dietary Requirements'), you'll have some attendees who are 
vegetarians or vegans, possibly some with food allergies and maybe others who 
require kosher or halal food. Although you may not be able to cater for all 
preferences, at least trying to provide some alternative options will help to 
include rather than alienate many attendees.

Regardless of the venue, some people won't come to the dinner and some will 
leave after the dinner. Most do attend the dinner, but not all. Caterers will 
want definite numbers, so it may be wise to allow for 90% of your anticipated 
number. Also bear in mind that some attendees will be travelling with partners 
and possibly family, and may want to bring them along. If you are planning to 
have an additional charge for guests, please ensure that attendees know this in 
advance. For Birmingham, our funds increased dramatically in the last few weeks, 
which meant we could invite all the guests free of charge.

In previous years, YAPC::Europe has had a "Speakers Dinners", which, while 
certainly a nice idea to thank the speakers, only served to segregate the 
attendees from the speakers. It meant attendees were deserted for a night and 
left to fend for themselves. If you weren't part of the "cabal", and it was your 
first time at a YAPC, it was a bad experience. Avoid any such dinners during 
the conference wherever possible. Chicago held a Speakers' Party after the 
conference, which was a much better time to host it, as many attendees were 
already making their way home by then, and of those attendees staying they had 
made new friends and knew the area well enough to not feel ignored.

If time and the dinner venue permits an entertainment program, as the Geek-Quiz
at YAPC::EU 2009 in Lisbon is certainly a great idea.

=head2 Other Evenings

Suggest other events, though not necessarily organised, for other nights of the 
conference. This may only require you to suggest a local pub or bar that is 
capable of holding most of your attendees. Some will want to hack away wherever 
the accommodations are, others will want to have food and drink elsewhere and 
get to know other attendees better. However, if you have a home base somewhere, 
most people will be reassured that they can at least find someone associated 
with the conference. This can be very important for first time attendees as many 
will not know anyone else. Be inclusive wherever possible.

=head2 Conference Auction

The auction is now a tradition with YAPCs. However, they vary in style from 
region to region. YAPC::NA holds their auction during the conference dinner, 
while YAPC::Europe holds theirs as the end of a conference day (Usually last
day but first day has also worked great, since many attendees leave early on
the last day). 

Not everyone will understand what the auction is about, especially some of the 
bizarre items in the European auction, so take the time to explain it. In recent 
years many attendees are coming to YAPCs for the first time and don't know the 
history and humour. Not everyone will participate in the auction, even on the 
boat in Toronto many people didn't participate in the auction, even though they 
were a captive audience. Some will want to help out by bidding on cool books and 
t-shirts, but not everyone will have large amounts of cash to donate.

Consider having a silent auction, where you can side line large numbers of books 
and t-shirts and the more sedate auction items, for attendees to bid on away 
from the main auction. If possible put up a web page with all the silent auction 
items, so that attendees can view them at their leisure. Make it easy for people 
to bid on the silent auction items, so they can bid early, often and keep the 
prices rising :)

The regular auction should feature some of the more rare or unusual items, which 
is what makes the auction fun and exciting and hopefully something to remember. 
Signed copies of books, special t-shirts, humiliations of the next YAPC 
organisers :) and dedications in code have all been good money spinners in the 
past.

Do you know a good auctioneer? The established YAPCs have several people who 
have now taken on the role of auctioneer, so you may well have several people 
who could help you with this. However, for your event, you may not have any of 
those people attending, so if any of your team or attendees are willing to get 
up and auctioneer. It also helps to have auction software that can keep track of 
bids. R Geoffery Avery has developed software used at YAPC::NA and YAPC::Europe, 
that may be of use.

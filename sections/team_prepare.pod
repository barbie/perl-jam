=head1 PREPARE YOUR TEAM

Z<team_prepare> You cannot organise this alone. While one day workshops might
be possible for one person to handle, organizing a conference is very time
consuming and spreading the workload enables the team to function better
together, and usually gets the job done a lot quicker. Recruit local user group
members, friends or colleagues to your team, particularly if anyone you know
has an area of expertise or special contacts.

In your bid, highlight the strengths in your team. If you've organised other 
conferences or workshops, let the committee know about that. The more 
confidence the venue committee has in your abilities, the more reassured they 
will be that you have done all that you can do to put on a great conference.

For now though, you only need to have a team. The exact tasks each person will 
be responsible for can be allocated later.

Plan some initial informal meetings to brainstorm ideas.

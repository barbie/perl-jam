=head0 ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Barbie was born in Congleton, Cheshire in 1965. He first became interested in 
computers with the launch of the Sinclair home computers (ZX80, ZX81 and ZX 
Spectrum) from 1980 onwards. Studied Computing at Lanchester Polytechnic (Now 
Coventry University) and joined GEC Telecommunications as a C programmer.

In 1998 he first discovered Perl, and in 1999 was offered his first job as a 
Perl programmer at tw2.com in Birmingham. Encouraged by I<Richard Clamp> and 
I<Dave 'The Goth' Thorn>, he became involved with the London Perl Mongers and 
then along with I<Mike Bissett> co-founded the B<Birmingham Perl Mongers>.

Since 2000, after attending the first YAPC::Europe in London, Barbie is one of
only few attendees that managed to attended every YAPC::Europe event up to,
and including the 2012 event in Frankfurt, Germany. After organising the 2006
YAPC::Europe Perl Conference, he decided to put pen to paper and write down all
the things that he felt future organisers should prepare themselves for. This
book has been many years in the making, and will likely never be finished. But
he says it has been fun!

=head1 THE NAME

It may surprise you to know that Barbie is actually the author's real name. How 
the name Barbie came about is a long story, and maybe if you buy him a Guinness 
at a future conference, workshop or large technical event, he might tell you it.
It might not be the true story, but it will be a long story ;)

=head1 WHY PERL JAM?

The idea for the name of the book came from fellow Birmingham Perl Monger, Steve 
Pitchford, who had the idea for a Perl event, which mixed coding with a musical 
jam session. We ultimately organised the YAPC::Europe event in 2006, but the 
name still hung around with the possibility for using for a hackathon of some 
kind. After Steve asked if anyone wanted the domain, perljam.info, it seemed to 
be an ideal fit for the name of the book.
